               ood has acquired a new religion—Peganism. The current buzzword in the wellness circuit is the pegan plan, which includes 75 percent vegetables and 25 percent high-quality meat. And it is for the inveterate weightwatchers. Most of us are familiar with either of the two surrogates of the pegan plan—paleo and vegan. Presented to the world by the US-based Cleveland Clinic doctor and bestselling author Dr Mark Hyman in 2015, the pegan diet supports a novel practice of nourishment by integrating the cores of the paleo diet with veganism. Astonishingly at the start, paleo and vegan diets seem to be an erratic combo in nature as the former is meat-based and the latter excludes any kind of animal product. Pegan inherits the best of both worlds—plant-rich, whole foods, healthy fats with minimum processed foods, and reduced sugar and starch intake.

            Sometimes, when we feel hungry, we seek culinary gratification in the form of munchies that are mostly devoid of nutrients. When we binge-eat these packaged foods, we feel sluggish afterwards.

“Such foods are termed ‘empty calories’. These are mainly foods and drinks that have high sugar, fat or alcohol content. Regular consumption of these foods heightens the risk of cardiovascular, lifestyle, and hormonal disorders, apart from the obvious weight gain and bloating,” says Trisha Agarwal, nutritionist at PositivEats.
